<h1><span style="color:blue">Dalgona coffee recipe</span></h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ol>
	<li>2 Tbsp instant coffee</li>
	<li>2 Tbsp white granulated sugar</li>
	<li>2 Tbsp water</li>
	<li>half cup milk</li>
</ol>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
	In a large mixing bowl, add coffee, sugar and HOT water in 1:1:1 ratio.
Whisking by hand - using a whisk, first mix the coffee, sugar and water until everything is melted. Then start whisking!!! It should form a hard peak in about 2 minute and 30-40 seconds OR do the challenge and whisk about 400 times.
IMPORTANT - use large mixing bowl (having enough space for your whisk to whip air in) and round whisk (fork or spoon will be too hard). Tilt at an angle. Watch video.
Whisking using a hand mixer or stand mixer - first mix at lowest speed until all the coffee and sugar are dissolved. Then turn the speed to highest setting and mix for 1 min 30 seconds or until hard peaks form. I have a Kitchenaid stand mixer and on it, it takes about 1 min and 30 seconds on highest speed. Handmixer probably is going to be a little longer since it's not as powerful but should work fine. Set aside.
OPTIONAL - make some Dalgona (Korean sponge candy) by following my recipe HERE. This adds a great crunchy and sweet topping to the foam.
Fill 2/3rd of a cup with cold milk (about 1/2 cup) and add some ice.
Spoon the foam and add it to the top of the cup. Top it with Dalgona pieces or try sprinkle the top with some hot cocoa powder or cinnamon. Mix it with a spoon to enjoy it as a latte or just as it is as you get a little bit of milk and foam in one sip. ENJOY!!!
