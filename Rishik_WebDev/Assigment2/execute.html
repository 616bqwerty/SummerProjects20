 		Incident, Indiaâ€™s largest run student fest, stands high and mighty being bestowed with a crown of ultimate art, culture and celebration. It serves as a launchpad for fresh talents, battleground for the best competitions, a host for the most renowned artists, an adobe to dance and music where a day would begin with soul-touching talk series and end with spectacular sundown sessions in the beach to make way for the stellar Pronites. Incident is a carnival where every street reflects colourful art. Every wave echoes festivity, and every minute spent will last for a lifetime. If you love the salty tinge of the ocean and enjoy art in its finest form. Surathkal is where you ought to be in march, Incident promises a complete experience for its audience and a tremendous headstart for the budding talent to conquer the impossible. Our belief in social interdependence has motivated us to initiate various socio-environmental programs too. Incident is about compassion for our people and our environment.
