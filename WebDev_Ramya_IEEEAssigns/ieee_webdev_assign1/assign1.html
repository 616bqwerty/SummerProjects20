      The Nightmare Before Christmas took three years to create, at 24 frames per second.
      The completed film has around 110,000 frames,
       and there were more than 400 heads with various expressions created for Jack alone.
       Surprised, aren’t you?

  <h2>How to get started</h2>
<h4>In simple words, here’s the process that is typically followed for creating stop motion animation (which you can try doing):</h4>
<ul>
<li>Place something in front of the cameras</li>
<li>Take a picture using your DSLR</li>
<li>Move the item slightly in one direction, take another picture</li>
<li>Move it again, click again</li>
<li>Follow this routine for a few times</li>
<li>String all these images together in the same sequence using an editing or animation tool</li>
<li><h2><span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Voila!</span></h2></li>
</ul>
